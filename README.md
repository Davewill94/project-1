MVP:

Bronze)

    Functionality:
        A game with four different tiles that light up for one second when they are active.
        Once a game has been started a random color should light up. 
        The game should light same existing pattern every turn and add one additional color on each turn. 
        After each click the in the pattern make sure the click is correct. 
        If an incorrect click is made end the game and tell them they lost. 
        If the player makes it thourgh the entire turns sequence without an error increment their score. 
        Make a start game and reset game button.

    Styling:
        At this point I hope to have decent styling in place.
        Four basic squares in a 2x2 pattern.
Silver)

    Functionality:
        If time permits maybe add an option for the player to 
        elect how many new colors are added to the combo pattern each turn.

    Styling:
        Add in a picture of a cat to the center of the color pattern.
        Add a visible score counter. Add updating score counter here?

Gold)

    Functionality:
        If time permits maybe add sounds for the colors like in the real game.

    Styling:
        Polish to more closely resembel the actual game.

Post-MVP:

    Post MVP I think it would be fun to make the squares move around the screen while playing.
